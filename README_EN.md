   * You are the best! ^^

### Known Bugs

* Sometimes animations may not display correctly (working on fixes).
* At night, certain animated elements may have white edges or desync issues due to masking (unfortunately, this may be unfixable).
* Version 5.2.8 may encounter mirror-related errors if using an outdated Simple Frameworks version—update to the latest.
* Old save files may display Eden’s injury textures incorrectly. If you've encountered Eden's injury event prior to installing this mod, use the command `[[Help!|$passage][$eden_hurt = 1]]` as a fix.
* Some saves may randomly trigger JavaScript interpreter errors (where PC and Eden sprites disappear). Changing hair color or eye color (through dyeing, cheats, or contact lenses) seems to resolve this.
